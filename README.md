# Skin-disease-dataset-augmentation-using-GAN

This repository contains code for a skin disease classification project using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image generation and classification.

## Overview

Skin diseases are a significant health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to classify skin diseases from images and generate synthetic skin disease images.

## Features

- **GAN for Image Generation:** Utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic skin disease images for augmenting the dataset.

- **CNN for Classification:** Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying skin diseases based on real and generated images.

- **Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation is located in the `train_set` directory. Please refer to the dataset documentation for details.

- **Preprocessing:** Includes preprocessing steps such as image normalization and data augmentation.
